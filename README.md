# ball-force-optimizer
## ðŸ§  High-Level Overview
This code implements a physics-based genetic optimization algorithm in the browser using JavaScript and HTML canvas.
It attempts to evolve a force graph that, when applied to a 2D particle (the "ball"), causes it to pass near a series of target points.
